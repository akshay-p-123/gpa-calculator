# gpa-calculator
Calculates weighted and unweighted GPA.

This program was created as an aid to students who need an easy way to calculate their end-of-year GPA. The program allows students to input each class's grade and corresponding weight separately. In the future, I plan
to improve the GUI and turn the program into a website.

This project was created in Python using the tkinter module, which I chose because of its lightweight API and straightforward implementation. On Windows, tkinter is included in the standard Python 3 installation, so no further installation is needed if you have Python installed.
On MacOS, follow this [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-on-macos/) to install tkinter. 
On Linux, follow this [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-on-linux/).
To install Python on all systems, use this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After downloading and running `main.py`, you will see this screen.

From there, choose if you want to calculate your weighted or unweighted GPA. Clicking the 'Weighted GPA' button will bring you to this screen:

After inputting your class's information, make sure to click the 'Add Class' button. This will add the inputted
class to the GPA calculation and prompt you to enter another one. After you're done entering classes, press the
'Calculate' button. A sample output is as follows.
